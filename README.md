This Javascript code uses the IP API to collect the user's current Country Code, city, zipcode, latitude, longitude, internet provider, and IP address. Each of these chunks of data are converted to their numerical utf-8 character codes. These numerical character codes are then used to create 6 wavetable oscillators, these oscillator's frequencies over time, the duration of each synth instance, and the duration of the musical composition as a whole. This drone-based implementation represents one way in which this data can be used to construct a mutable collection of generative musical compositions.

For my final project, I would like to expand on this work to create a generative system that uses this data to explore multiple different musical terranes. Some examples:
-using the data as durational ratios to create polyrhythmic textures
-using the data to manipulate samples
-using the data as a formal guide, a way to move between sections of music on a macro-level
-using the data to when/how various sonic materials are sent to effects units

Essentially, I would like to explore and experiment fruitful ways of massaging this data into novel musical material, where the data acts as a strict dialectic to my compositional decision making.

I am also interested in adding a visual element and possibly an interactive element.
